DART (Detect and avoid Artifical Reality Testing) is an open community benchmarking system to evaluate detect and avoid algorithms for drones and other aircraft.
Our work as to v1.0 reached TRL 4 (proof of concept). We welcome the community to join us in building on these foundations with the vision to have a standardised system to evaluate DAA systems. An overview video of the project is [available here](https://youtu.be/X2zolGSnKZc). 2021 work was funded by the Dft D-Trig program.




## Scope

DART v1.0 is designed around scenarion 1, single aircraft on collison course.
